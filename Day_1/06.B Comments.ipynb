Before you use a module, skim over its docs, before you use a function, have a look there (and see below for ipython's ?).  Refuse the temptation to guess.\n",

Just as you have to read novels to write *good* texts, read and try to understand code passed to you (or perhaps just library code, which tends to be „good” in one way or another).  The least it will do is show you what not to do if you'd like other people to understand your program."
