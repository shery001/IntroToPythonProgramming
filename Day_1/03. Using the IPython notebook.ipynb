    "The IPython *notebook* is a feature that allows you to write \"notebooks\" similar to, e.g., Mathematica or Matlab. An advantage of doing this is that you can include text, code, and plots in the same document. This makes it suitable for example to write up a report about a project that uses mostly Python code, in order to share with others. In fact, the notes for this course are written using the IPython notebook.\n",
